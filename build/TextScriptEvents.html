<h2>Predefined global script functions</h2>
<p>In your main global script file, there are some functions which are automatically added when you create the game. These are global events, and the function is called when a particular event happens. There are also some other events which you can add if you want to.</p>
<p>The available event functions are:</p>
<p><em>dialog_request (int parameter)</em></p>
<p>Called when a dialog script line "run-script" is processed. PARAMETER is the value of the number following the "run-script" on that line of the dialog script.</p>
<p><em>game_start ()</em></p>
<p>Called at the start of the game, before the first room is loaded. You can use this to set up the initial positions of characters, and to turn GUIs on and off. <strong>You cannot run animations or do anything else which relies on a room being loaded</strong>.</p>
<p><em>interface_click (int interface, int button)</em></p>
<p><strong>(Now Obsolete)</strong> Called when the player clicks on a button on a GUI which has its action set as "Run script". INTERFACE is the number of the GUI which they clicked on. BUTTON is the object number of the button within this GUI.</p>
<p><em>on_event (EventType event, int data)</em></p>
<p>Called whenever certain game events happen. The value of DATA depends on which event has occurred. This allows you to perform checks or update things every time the player does something, regardless of which room it is in. The possible values of event are:</p>
<pre><code>eEventEnterRoomBeforeFadein
      called just before room Player Enters Room event is run.
      DATA = new room number
eEventLeaveRoom
      called just after room Player Leaves Room event is run.
      DATA = room number they are leaving
eEventGotScore
      called whenever the player&#39;s score changes
      DATA = number of points they got
eEventGUIMouseDown
      called when a mouse button is pressed down over a GUI
      DATA = GUI number
eEventGUIMouseUp
      called when a mouse button is released over a GUI
      DATA = GUI number
eEventAddInventory
      the player just got a new inventory item
      DATA = inventory item number that was added
eEventLoseInventory
      the player just lost an inventory item
      DATA = inventory item number that was lost
eEventRestoreGame
      tells your game that it has just been restored from a save game
      DATA = save slot number
</code></pre>
<p><em>on_key_press (eKeyCode keycode)</em></p>
<p>Called whenever a key is pressed on the keyboard. KEYCODE holds the ASCII value of the key. A list of these values is in <a href="ASCIIcodes.html">this section</a>.</p>
<p><em>on_mouse_click (MouseButton button)</em></p>
<p>Called when the player clicks a mouse button. BUTTON is either LEFT, RIGHT or MIDDLE, depending on which button was clicked. The "mouse.x" and "mouse.y" global variables contain the mouse's position.<br> If 'Handle inventory clicks in script' is enabled in the game options, this function can also be called with eMouseLeftInv, eMouseMiddleInv or eMouseRightInv, which indicate a left, middle or right click on an inventory item, respectively.<br> If 'Enable mouse wheel support' is enabled, this function can also be called with eMouseWheelNorth or eMouseWheelSouth, which indicate the user moving the mouse wheel north or south, respectively.</p>
<p><em>repeatedly_execute()</em></p>
<p>Called every game cycle (normally 40 times per second). See <a href="RepExec.html">this help page</a> for more information.</p>
<p><em>repeatedly_execute_always()</em></p>
<p>Called every game cycle, even when a blocking routine (eg. speech/cutscene) is in progress. You <strong>cannot</strong> call any blocking functions from this event handler. <strong>repeatedly_execute_always</strong> is called <strong>BEFORE</strong> the game objects (characters, rooms, etc) get updated. See <a href="RepExec.html">this help page</a> for more information.</p>
<p><em>late_repeatedly_execute_always()</em></p>
<p>Called every game cycle, even when a blocking routine (eg. speech/cutscene) is in progress. You <strong>cannot</strong> call any blocking functions from this event handler. <strong>late_repeatedly_execute_always</strong> is called <strong>AFTER</strong> the game objects (characters, rooms, etc) got updated, but before game is redrawn on screen.</p>
<p><em>unhandled_event (int what, int type)</em></p>
<p>Called when an event occurs, but no handler is set up in the Events list. This could be used to display a default "I can't do that" type of message. The values of WHAT and TYPE tell you what the player did.<br> The possible values are listed below:</p>

<p>Note that the "Character stands on hotspot" event does not trigger this function, and it will not be triggered if there is an "Any click" event defined.</p>
<p>This function is <strong>not</strong> triggered if the player clicks on nothing (hotspot 0).</p>
<p>The <em>on_key_press</em> and <em>on_mouse_click</em> events can also be handled by individual room scripts. If you add their function definitions to your room script in a similar way to how they are in the global script, the room script can intercept the keypress/mouseclick first, and then decide whether to pass it on to the global script or not. See the <a href="Game.html#claimevent">ClaimEvent</a> function for more.</p>
