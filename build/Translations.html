<h2>Translations</h2>
<p>AGS now makes it easy for you to create translations of your games. Right-click the "Translations" node in the tree, and choose "New translation". Once you've named it, AGS will ask if you want to populate the file now. Say yes.</p>
<p>Creating the translation writes all lines of game text to the file - no script sources, just all the displayable text from the game. The file is generated with each line of text separated by a blank line.</p>
<p>You can now give this file to your translators. They should <strong>fill in each blank line with the corresponding translation of the English line above it (DO NOT REPLACE THE ORIGINAL ENGLISH LINES WITH THE TRANSLATION)</strong>. If a line is left blank, it will simply not be translated.</p>
<p>Once the translation is done, right-click the translation and choose "Compile". It will be converted into a compiled translation (<code>.TRA</code>) file in the Compiled folder, which can be used with the game engine.</p>
<p>Run the game Setup program, and select the translation from the drop-down box. Then, run the game, and all the text should be translated.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: With SCI fonts, only 128 characters are available, so many of the extended characters needed for non-english translations are not available. You may need to use substitute characters, or consider using TTF fonts for international applications. However, bear in mind that TTF rendering slows down the engine.</em></p>
<p>While most in-game text is translated automatically, there are a few instances when this is not possible. These are when a script uses functions like Append to build up a string, or CompareTo to check some user input. In these cases, you can use the <a href="Game.html#gettranslation">GetTranslation</a> function to make it work.</p>
<p>You'll also have noticed a "Update" option when right-clicking a translation. This is useful if you've got a translated version of your game, but you want to update the game and add a few bits in. Once you've updated your game, run the Update Translation option and the translation file you select will get any new bits of text added to it at the bottom -- then you can just ask your translator to additionally translate these lines.</p>
